# 5LayerCNN_birdclassification
5-Layered CNN project to identify birds - ACM Fall Onboarding Project, won best Model + Paper Award
# MLab Onboarding Project â€“ Fall 2024

This repository contains my completed onboarding project for Stanford ACMLab (Fall 2024). The goal of this project was to demonstrate familiarity with data handling, model implementation, and experimental analysis (specifically for CNNs) using standard machine learning tools and practices.

## Project Summary

In this notebook, I:
- Loaded and explored a sample dataset
- Performed preprocessing and parameter hypertuning
- Implemented and trained a basic 5 layered CNN with dropout layers and pooling
- Evaluated model performance using metrics and visualizations
